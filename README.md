# LeetCodeSolutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a popular online platform for practicing coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. This project serves as a learning resource and a place to store my solutions for future reference.

## About LeetCode

LeetCode is a website where programmers can practice solving coding problems and improve their problem-solving skills. It offers a wide range of problems covering various topics, such as data structures, algorithms, and system design. The problems are categorized by difficulty level, ranging from easy to hard.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the problem categories or topics. Each directory contains one or more subdirectories representing individual problems. Within each problem directory, you will find the following files:

- `/src/` : A file containing the code for solving a problem written in the java programming language. Each class is named according to the problem solved, the class contains solutions to this or that problem.
To run the solution, the Main class has the main method, where you can create an instance of the solution object and run it.

## Usage

You can use this repository as a reference for solving LeetCode problems or as a learning resource to understand different problem-solving approaches and techniques. Feel free to explore the solutions, study the code, and adapt it to your needs.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improving the solutions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the LeetCode community for providing such an excellent platform for practicing coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. The problems and solutions in this repository are inspired by and based on the LeetCode platform.
